# Dialog editor

You can try it out here: https://dirakon.github.io/Dialog-Editor/
    
Interactive dialog editor where user can program their own dialogs using dialog writing 'scripting' language made by me. First experience working with JavaScript (and React too, obviously). Supports variables and tags, if statements. Includes dialog example when opening the site.
